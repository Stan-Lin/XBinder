# XBinder 

The development of XBinder presents four important features. 
First, it provides a cross-platform communication mechanism. XBinder could be installed on Linux or Android system, then all processes, whether applications or services, 
can cooperate with each other running on the same platform or different platform through the functionality of XBinder. 

Second, XBinder helps simplify the development and usage of remote objects. It works well without the programmer explicitly coding the details for low-level socket operations and remote interactions. 

Third, every platform with XBinder installed is a peer node which, by directly transmitting network packets to other nodes, provides and applies remote services. 

Fourth, XBinder supports concurrent operations for multiple connections. The connections and services of different nodes are isolated, and therefore there is no interference when the nodes are working concurrently.
